# Redis autosuggest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KlausTrainer/redis-autosuggest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KlausTrainer/redis-autosuggest)

## About

Salvatore Sanfilippo (aka antirez) once published a blog article titled [Auto Complete with Redis](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/autocomplete-with-redis.html), where he shows how Redis makes building a simple autocomplete (aka autosuggest) feature easy.  The article also contains a working example, which is a small Ruby program (see [here](https://gist.github.com/antirez/574044)).  This repository here provides a JavaScript port of that very Ruby program, as well as a few tests.
